# ZW Steganography
ZW (Zero-Width) Steganography uses 2 unicode characters, 200b and 200c. They are rendered invisible by most applications and proves useful to hide hidden messages in plain text.

# What is Steganography?
Steganography in simple terms is the art of hiding messages in other messages. Tools like this allow you to hide messages in other messages and extract hidden messages from messages.

# Do not use for privacy
Sure, you can use for messaging so one peaking into your messages wont be aware of the text, but it isn't cryptography. This is something that is easy to detect despite being invisible during render of the chracters within the text. AI, Advanced text editors, IDEs are good examples of how this is detectable.

# Usage
This is currently not setup to use, the code is only for preview. However you may use my code for your own use.
